Gigahorse
=========

Gigahorse is an HTTP client for Scala with [Async Http Client][AHC] underneath.

### Setup

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.eed3si9n" %% "gigahorse-core" % "$gigahorse_version$"
```

### Dependencies

Gigahorse depends on Scala, [AHC 1.9][AHC], which brings in [Netty 3][netty].
It also depends on [Lightbend SSL Config][sslconfig] and [Lightbend Config][config].

### Credits

- The implementation was based from [The Play WS API][ws],
  including the way AHC is called and the choice of default values.
  In particular, it uses [Lightbend Config][config] and [@wsargent][@wsargent]'s [SSL Config][sslconfig],
  which uses securer defaults.
- API design is also strongly influenced by that of [Dispatch Reboot][dispatch] by [@n8han][@n8han].
- All datatypes are generated using [sbt-datatype][datatype], which [@Duhemm][@Duhemm] and I worked on.
- Finally, props go to [Async Http Client][AHC] and [Netty][netty] for the actual HTTP work.

### Quick start

Here's a quick example of how to make a GET call using Gigahorse:

```console
scala> import gigahorse._
scala> import scala.concurrent._, duration._
scala> Gigahorse.withHttp(Gigahorse.config) { http =>
         val r = Gigahorse.url("http://api.duckduckgo.com").get.
           addQueryString(
             "q" -> "1 + 1",
             "format" -> "json"
           )
         val f = http.run(r, Gigahorse.asString andThen {_.take(60)})
         Await.result(f, 120.seconds)
       }
```
