Processing the Response
-----------------------

Once you build a `Request` value, you can pass it to `HttpClient`
to execute the request using `run`, `download`, or `process` methods.

### http.run(r, f)

There are many methods on `HttpClient`, but probably the most useful one is
`http.run(r, f)` method. As we saw in [Basic Concepts][concepts] page
this take a `Request` value, and a function `Response => A`.

Gigahorse provides `Gigahorse.asString` function to return `Future[String]`,
but we can imagine this could be expanded to do more.

Another thing to note is that `run` method will only accept HTTP 2XX statuses,
and fail the future value otherwise. (By default 3XX redirects are handled automatically)

### Post-processing a Future

In addition to passing in a function, a `Future` can easily be post-processed
by mapping inside it.

```console:new
scala> import gigahorse._
scala> import scala.concurrent._, duration._
scala> import ExecutionContext.Implicits._
scala> Gigahorse.withHttp(Gigahorse.config) { http =>
         val r = Gigahorse.url("http://api.duckduckgo.com").get.
           addQueryString(
             "q" -> "1 + 1",
             "format" -> "json"
           )
         val f0: Future[Response] = http.run(r, identity)
         val f: Future[String] = f0 map { Gigahorse.asString andThen (_.take(60)) }
         Await.result(f, 120.seconds)
       }
```

Whenever an operation is done on a `Future`, an implicit execution context must be available
-- this declares which thread pool the callback to the future should run in.

For convenience there's an overload of `run` that takes only the `Request` parameter.

### Lifting the Response to Either

One of the common processing when dealing with a Future that can fail is to
lift the inner `A` value to `Either[Throwable, A]`.

There's a convenient website called <http://getstatuscode.com/>
that can emulate HTTP statuses. Here's what happens when we await on a failed Future.

```console:error
scala> Gigahorse.withHttp(Gigahorse.config) { http =>
         val r = Gigahorse.url("http://getstatuscode.com/500")
         val f = http.run(r, Gigahorse.asString)
         Await.result(f, 120.seconds)
       }
```

Gigahorse provides a mechanism called `Gigahorse.asEither` to
lift the inner `A` value to `Either[Throwable, A]` as follows:

```console
scala> Gigahorse.withHttp(Gigahorse.config) { http =>
         val r = Gigahorse.url("http://getstatuscode.com/500")
         val f = http.run(r, Gigahorse.asEither)
         Await.result(f, 120.seconds)
       }
```

`asEither` can be mapped over as a right-biased `Either`.

```console
scala> Gigahorse.withHttp(Gigahorse.config) { http =>
         val r = Gigahorse.url("http://getstatuscode.com/200")
         val f = http.run(r, Gigahorse.asEither map {
           Gigahorse.asString andThen (_.take(60)) })
         Await.result(f, 120.seconds)
       }
```

### Downloading a file

A file can be downloaded using `download` method:

```console
scala> import java.io.File
scala> Gigahorse.withHttp(Gigahorse.config) { http =>
         val file = new File(new File("target"), "Google_2015_logo.svg")
         val r = Gigahorse.url("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Google_2015_logo.svg")
         val f = http.download(r, file)
         Await.result(f, 120.seconds)
       }
```

This will return `Future[File]`.

### http.process(r, f)

If you do not wish to throw an error on non-2XX responses, and for example
read the body text of a 500 response, use `process` method.

```console
scala> Gigahorse.withHttp(Gigahorse.config) { http =>
         val r = Gigahorse.url("http://getstatuscode.com/500")
         val f = http.process(r, Gigahorse.asString andThen (_.take(60)))
         Await.result(f, 120.seconds)
       }
```

`HttpClient` also implements `run` method that accepts `Gigahorse.toEither` too.

### Asynchronous processing using CompletionHandler

Finally, Gigahorse offers an overload of `process` method that
lets you access the full power of AsyncHttpClient.

```scala
  /** Executes the request. Does not error on non-OK response. */
  def process[A](request: Request, handler: CompletionHandler[A]): Future[A]
```

Here's how `CompletionHandler` looks like:

```scala
import com.ning.http.client.{ Response => XResponse, _ }

abstract class CompletionHandler[A] {
  val builder = new XResponse.ResponseBuilder

  def onStatusReceived(status: HttpResponseStatus): State = {
    builder.reset()
    builder.accumulate(status)
    State.Continue
  }

  def onHeadersReceived(headers: HttpResponseHeaders): State = {
    builder.accumulate(headers)
    State.Continue
  }

  def onBodyPartReceived(content: HttpResponseBodyPart): State = {
    builder.accumulate(content)
    State.Continue
  }

  def onCompleted(response: Response): A
}
```

This is the most basic building block that you can build everything else.
For example, `download` is implementing as follows:

```scala
  def download(request: Request, file: File): Future[File] =
    process(request, new OkHandler[File](_ => ???) {
      import java.io.FileOutputStream
      val out = new FileOutputStream(file)
      override def onBodyPartReceived(content: HttpResponseBodyPart): State = {
        content.writeTo(out)
        State.Continue
      }
      override def onCompleted(response: Response) = file
    })
```

This will write into the `FileOutputStream` as the parts arrive,
without copying the bytes into the buffer.
